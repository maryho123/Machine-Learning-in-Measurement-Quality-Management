# Machine-Learning
Machine Learning Module written in python that I created at NIST in the summer of 2017. This was written to be added to [pyMeasure](https://aricsanders.github.io/), a python package by Aric Sanders.

The module is intended to make it easy to format and interpolate scientific data, as well as generate new data, and train and test machine learning classifiers off of the data. This was made so that machine learning-based tests involving scientific data would be easier to pull off.

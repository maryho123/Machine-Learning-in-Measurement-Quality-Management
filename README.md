# Machine-Learning-in-Measurement-Quality-Management     
Machine learning has made it possible to automatically review data and determine 
its quality. A machine learning algorithm can characterize how a data set is ‘bad’. Furthermore, another direction for the algorithm is 
identifying the basics of the experiment and determining the configuration of the experiment based on pervious experience.
The best way to train the machine is through a  quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) classifier. It is flexible 
and fits the data better because the decision boundaries are quadratic in the predictor space. 
The goal of this project was to create a machine learning algorithm that improves the measurement process by 
determining the sources of error in a data set through a comparison of previously collected data known to be 
‘good’ or ‘bad’. This can also determine what device under test (DUT) is attached to the vector network analyzer 
(VNA) through analyzing the measured scattering parameter (S-Parameters)  and resistance.
